        <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>Public environments like theme parks are typically not accommodating to those with sensory issues (commonly seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Sensory Processing Disorder.) This can lead to individuals using situation avoidance as a coping mechanism, therefore missing out on social learning opportunities.</p>

        <h3>OUR SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>We created the Halcyon Sensory Spaceship, a comprehensive, immersive, and fully controllable sensory experience. The Spaceship puts the user in the captain’s seat, the environment adapts to entirely to their sensory needs. After the experience, the user able to re-enter the public environment feeling calm and secure.</p>

        <h3>DESIGNING FOR ONE (AND FOR ALL)</h3>
        <h1>This is AJ.</h1>
        <h2 >He was diagnosed with high
          functioning Autism at age 3,
          and is now 11 years old.</h2>
        <p>He is wicked good at math, always cracking
          jokes, and utterly obsessed with Star Wars.
          He likes to spend most of his days hanging
          out with his family and playing video games,
          like your average 11 year old boy. He was
          diagnosed with High Functioning Autism at
          the age of 3, and was diagnosed with panic
            disorder later in life around age 10. He is very
            social, and loves making new friends, however
            adapting to new environments can be a very
            intense experience for him which frequently
            causes him to feel anxiety from a strong fear
            of the unknown. He is a very sweet boy, rarely
            breaking out in aggressive behavior and you’ll
            almost always see him with a smile on his
            face. One of our teammates has a close tie
            to him, therefore we’ve decided to design a
            solution just for him (with hopes that it can be
            a solution for many).</p>

       <p>We’ve set out to switch the narrative from
         disorder to a gift which grants individuals
         with unique perceptions of the world. As they
         say, when you’ve met one person with Autism,
         you’ve met one person with Autism. We hope
         that through this process we can give a voice to
         those with Autism and heightened sensitivities,
         and family members of those individuals.
         We firmly believe that through designing an
         adaptable and flexible environment we can
         change perceptions, and shift the conversation
         to one that is more celebratory of the passion,
         sensitivity, and laser focus often seen in people
         on the spectrum. Follow us through our senior
         capstone, to understand how our research drove

              <h2>Armed with AJ's list of requirements, we dove into low-fidelity prototyping.</h2>
              <p>We constructed a cardboard spaceship at scale to test the ergonomics at
                scale and walk through the interaction with our users. We handed our users sharpies
                to edit the design on the fly. From here, we recognized some major usability issues
                with the spaceship design like the lack of wheelchair access and room for the caretaker.</p>

                <p>The original plan for our second design sprint was to construt
                  the spaceship at full scale and functionality. This full-scale
                functional prototype would be donated to the Matthew Reardon Center for Autism,
                a facility we toured during our first round of research, to join their
                new sensory playground. Unfortunately, the world is an unpredictable place
                so these plans were put on hold and the spaceship construction turned digital.</p>
